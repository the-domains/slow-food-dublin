**May 30, 8-10pm**

**Wigwam Bar, ****54 Middle Abbey St.**

Join us for an evening of food stories that break from the usual stereotypes of Irish gastronomy. Drawn from memories of home, travel, work, and play, personal stories tell the 'unofficial' version of Dublin's food, yet one that is more accurate than history generally records. On the centennial of Easter 1916, what could be more revolutionary than telling our own tales of food?

All are encouraged to bring and tell a food story from their personal memory. Email us at [dublin@slowfoodireland.com][0] to confirm a slot.

This event is presented by Slow Food Dublin and the University of Gastronomic Sciences' Eco-Gastronomy Project.
